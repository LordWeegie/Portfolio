  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    I'm primarily a front-end developer, though I'm currently exploring back-end development.<br>
    I know Python, HTML, PHP, C (though I’m not confident with memory management), GDScript, some JavaScript, and some C#.<br>
    My experience includes web development, extensive game development, and general application development. I also make a decent project manager.<br>
    I’ve been coding for about two years now.<br>
    I’m eager to learn any language or skill required for a role. While I don’t have an extensive portfolio, I’ve built several projects for CS50 and participated in game jams. Most of my time is spent learning and experimenting.<br>
    If you'd like to see my work, here are links to my <a href="https://github.com/LordWeegie/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://lordweegie.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> pages.
